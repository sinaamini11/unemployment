# Predicting unemployment from Google Trends Data
This repository uses machine learning to predict the monthly unemployment rate
in the United States before the official rate is released.

## Background
On the first Friday of each month, at 8:30 AM Eastern Time, the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics releases the unemployment rate of the previous month. Minutes
after it is released, it shows up on our news outlets where economists debate on
it and discuss its implications.

As a significant economic indicator however, the released rate takes merely
miliseconds to change the course of the securities market. That's because banks
and financial service provider companies have algorithms in place that will
immediately read the released rate and trade according to it.

Therefore if a bank, or financial service provider company has a tool that can
accurately predict the unemployment rate before it is released, they can use
that information to beat the stock market.
